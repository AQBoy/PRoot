and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>, that means users don't need any privilege or
setup to use an arbitrary directory as the new root file-system, to
make files accessible somewhere else in the file-system hierarchy, and
to execute programs built for another CPU architecture transparently
through QEMU.  PRoot relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call
available in every Linux kernels.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, as if they were part of the
guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses QEMU to execute
transparently guest programs.  It's a convenient way to develop, to
build, and to validate any guest Linux packages seamlessly on users'
computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em> guest environment.  That
way all of the cross-compilation issues are avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU.  This is useful to use programs
that aren't available initially in the guest environment and to speed
up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or any CPU independent
program, like interpreters.</p></div><div xmlns="" class="section" id="example"><h2>Example</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div class="section" id="chroot"><h3><tt>chroot</tt></h3><p>To execute a program inside a given Linux distribution, users just
have to specify the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file, both are from the guest distro:</p><pre>proot /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> if none were specified, thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-processes
is:</p><pre>proot /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div class="section" id="mount\ --bind"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt></h3><p>The option <tt>-b</tt>, short for <tt>--bind</tt>, makes files from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if they were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><pre>proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        -bash
?        proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/
?        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/sh
?        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /usr/bin/ps -o tty,command</pre><p>Actually there's a bunch of such specific files, that's why PRoot
provides the option <tt>-B</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -B /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    -bash
pts/6    proot -B /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/sh
pts/6    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /usr/bin/ps -o tty,command</pre><p>The bind mechanism can also be used to relocate files and directories
in the host rootfs by using <tt>/</tt> as the path to the guest rootfs.  It
is quite handy to cheat programs that perform access to hard-coded
locations, like not well written installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_usr:/usr /

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog "/usr/bin"
[...] # prog was installed in "/tmp/alternate_usr/bin" actually</pre><p>or to substitute system configuration files, for example the DNS
setting:</p><pre>proot -b ./alternate_resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf / resolveip google.com</pre></div><div class="section" id="binfmt_misc"><h3><tt>binfmt_misc</tt></h3><p>PRoot uses QEMU to execute programs built for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one.  From users' point-of-view, emulated
guest programs are executed transparently, that is, just like host
programs.  To enable this feature users just have to specify which
instance of QEMU they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt> or <tt>-Q</tt>
(this latter implies <tt>-B</tt>):</p><pre>proot -Q qemu-arm /mnt/armslack-12.2/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q/-Q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU
command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port 1234:</p><pre>proot -Q "qemu-arm -g 1234" /mnt/armslack-12.2/ emacs</pre><p>PRoot has a mode to allow the execution of host programs alongside
emulated guest programs, that is, they share the same file-system
namespace.  It's typically useful to extend the list of available
programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This mixed-mode is
enabled by substituting the <tt>-Q</tt> option with <tt>-X</tt>, then the content
of the host rootfs is accessible through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -X qemu-arm /mnt/armslack-12.2/

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo 'Hello mixed world!'
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -X qemu-arm /mnt/armslack-12.2/

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -Q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make /mnt/armslack-12.2/

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It's worth mentioning that even when mixing the execution of host
programs and the execution of emulated guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div class="section" id="download"><h2>Download</h2><p>
